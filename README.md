# Into

This is a personal repository that I use for my quick setup process whenever I pull up a brand new environment for VMs

# Usage

To run the main script that installs the pre-requisites for Windows Terminal to be able to run on the server plus the most commonly used programs, run the following command:
```powershell
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bendusz/server-setup/main/setup.ps1'))
```

# Rest
The rest of the scripts are just a quick markdowns of commonly used codes.
